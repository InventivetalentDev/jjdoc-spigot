{"name":"HelpTopicFactory","comment":"A HelpTopicFactory is used to create custom {@link HelpTopic} objects from\n commands that inherit from a common base class or have executors that\n inherit from a common base class. You can use a custom HelpTopic to change\n the way all the commands in your plugin display in the help. If your plugin\n implements a complex permissions system, a custom help topic may also be\n appropriate.\n \u003cp\u003e\n To automatically bind your plugin\u0027s commands to your custom HelpTopic\n implementation, first make sure all your commands or executors derive from\n a custom base class (it doesn\u0027t have to do anything). Next implement a\n custom HelpTopicFactory that accepts your custom command base class and\n instantiates an instance of your custom HelpTopic from it. Finally,\n register your HelpTopicFactory against your command base class using the\n {@link HelpMap#registerHelpTopicFactory(Class, HelpTopicFactory)} method.\n \u003cp\u003e\n As the help system iterates over all registered commands to make help\n topics, it first checks to see if there is a HelpTopicFactory registered\n for the command\u0027s base class. If so, the factory is used to make a help\n topic rather than a generic help topic. If no factory is found for the\n command\u0027s base class and the command derives from {@link\n org.bukkit.command.PluginCommand}, then the type of the command\u0027s executor\n is inspected looking for a registered HelpTopicFactory. Finally, if no\n factory is found, a generic help topic is created for the command.","isClass":false,"isInterface":true,"isEnum":false,"isEnumConstant":false,"isConstructor":false,"isField":false,"isMethod":false,"isOrdinaryClass":false,"isPrimitive":false,"simpleName":"HelpTopicFactory","qualifiedName":"org.bukkit.help.HelpTopicFactory","dimension":"","elementType":{},"package":"org.bukkit.help","interfaces":[],"isAbstract":true,"isStatic":false,"innerClasses":[],"isInnerClass":false,"constructors":[],"fields":[],"methods":[{"name":"createTopic","comment":"This method accepts a command deriving from a custom command base class\n and constructs a custom HelpTopic for it.","isClass":false,"isInterface":false,"isEnum":false,"isEnumConstant":false,"isConstructor":false,"isField":false,"isMethod":true,"isOrdinaryClass":false,"signature":"(TCommand)","flatSignature":"(TCommand)","returnType":{"isPrimitive":false,"simpleName":"HelpTopic","qualifiedName":"org.bukkit.help.HelpTopic","dimension":"","elementType":{}},"isAbstract":true,"isDefault":false,"isStatic":false,"parameters":[{"name":"command","type":{"isPrimitive":false,"simpleName":"TCommand","qualifiedName":"TCommand","dimension":"","elementType":{},"typeVariable":{"name":"TCommand","bounds":["org.bukkit.command.Command"]}}}],"typeParameters":[]}],"typeParameters":[{"name":"TCommand","bounds":["org.bukkit.command.Command"]}],"enumConstants":[]}
